* Rapid wreck assessment near Tristan da Cunha
* Development of the Tristan da Cunha Marine Protection Zone Management Plan
* Ecology of *Pheronema carpenteri* aggregations in the Porcupine Seabight
* Global habitat classification for the deep-sea benthos
* Habitat suitability modelling (HSM) of VMEs (*Demsophyllum pertusum* reef and *P. carpenteri*)in the North Atlantic
