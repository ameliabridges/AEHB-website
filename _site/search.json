      "contents": "\nAbout me\n\n\n\n\nI am a deep-sea ecologist with research interests broadly falling\ninto two fields: spatial ecology in the deep sea, and the use of science\nto inform policy and marine spatial planning. I have investigated the\nformer both at broad- and fine-scales by employing predictive modelling\napproaches.\nI am particularly interested in how to best facilitate the use of\npredictive model outputs in ocean policy to ensure ecosystem-based\nmanagement is based on best available data, and is possible for the deep\nsea despite the general paucity of data.\n\nMy PhD\n\n\n\n\nI completed my PhD, titled ‘Ecological Studies of the South\nAtlantic Deep Sea to Inform Sustainable Management’, at the\nUniversity of Plymouth in the UK. This was in collaboration with the\nCentre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (Cefas),\nBritish Antarctic Survey (BAS) and the Norwegian Institute of Marine\nResearch (IMR).\nMy research focused on describing patterns in the ecology of\nseamounts in the South Atlantic, linking these with environmental\nparameters, and incorporating this baseline information into products\nthat support science-based decision making regarding management\nregimes.\n\nKey methodologies I employed included:\nUni- and multivariate statistical analysis of ecological data\n(e.g. generalised additive models, general linear mixed effects models,\ndistance-based linear models, non-metric multidimensional scaling)\nHabitat suitability modelling (HSM)\nBroad-scale, non-hierarchical habitat classification\n\nLife after PhD\nI am now a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the University of\nPlymouth, UK. My current research is part of the NERC-funded Seabed\nMining And Resilience To EXperimental impact (SMARTEX) project. My role\nwithin this project is to develop larval dispersal models for deep-sea\ntaxa within the Clarion-Clipperton Fracture Zone (CCZ), the area in the\ncentral equatorial Pacific where multiple mining licenses have been\nawarded to companies and governments. Specifically, these are licenses\nto mine polymetallic nodules which are small potato-sized deposits on\nthe seafloor that are rich in several important minerals. These nodules\nprovide hard substrate in an otherwise soft-substrate environment, and\nhence support distinct faunal communities. The larval dispersal models\nwill help us to understand how areas within the CCZ are connected, and\nfurther develop our understanding of what the future effects of deep-sea\nmining might be on these fragile communities.\nAside from my main postdoctoral role, I am also actively engaged in a\nnumber of other projects and programmes. These include Challenger 150, a\nUN Ocean Decade Programme, where I am a member of the Central and South\nAtlantic Regional Working Group, and the Deep Ocean Stewardship\nInitiative (DOSI) where I am a member of the Fisheries Working\nGroup.\nSince 2021, I have also undertaken some consultancy work. This has\nincluded analysis of image data collected by the Joint Nature\nConservation Committee (advisers to the UK government) from the deep sea\nto the north of Scotland, and contribution to reports focusing on areas\nwithin the South Atlantic for Blue Marine Foundation.\nOther academic interests\n\n\n\n\nScience communication and public engagement has always been a passion\nof mine, and in addition to my university-based and consultancy work, I\nam heavily involved in local marine conservation around Cornwall in the\nUK. I currently Chair the Looe Marine Conservation Group and act as\ntheir Scientific Officer. Alongside our public engagement campaign where\nwe typically organise and run 30+ events per year ranging from guided\nrockpooling to beach cleaning, our scientific projects include\nmonitoring of intertidal and subtidal habitats including rocky shores,\nseagrass beds and oyster reefs. I have combined this passion with my\nwork at the University of Plymouth, enabling me to act as an external\nsupervisor for undergraduate, postgraduate and placement students.\n\n\n\n\n",
