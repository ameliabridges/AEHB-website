I am a deep-sea ecologist with research interests broadly falling into two fields: spatial ecology in the deep sea, and the use of science to inform policy and marine spatial planning. I have investigated the former both at broad- and fine-scales by employing predictive modelling approaches. 

I am particularly interested in how to best facilitate the use of predictive model outputs in ocean policy to ensure ecosystem-based management is based on best available data, and is possible for the deep sea despite the general paucity of data.

I completed my PhD, titled '*Ecological Studies of the South Atlantic Deep Sea to Inform Sustainable Management*', at the University of Plymouth in the UK. This was in collaboration with the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (Cefas), British Antarctic Survey (BAS) and the Norwegian Institute of Marine Research (IMR).

My research focused on describing patterns in the ecology of seamounts in the South Atlantic, linking these with environmental parameters, and incorporating this baseline information into products that support science-based decision making regarding management regimes.

Key methodologies I employed included:

- Uni- and multivariate statistical analysis of ecological data (e.g. generalised additive models, general linear mixed effects models, distance-based linear models, non-metric multidimensional scaling)
- Habitat suitability modelling (HSM)
- Broad-scale, non-hierarchical habitat classification

# Life after PhD

I am now a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the University of Plymouth, UK. My current research is part of the NERC-funded Seabed Mining And Resilience To EXperimental impact (SMARTEX) project. My role within this project is to develop larval dispersal models for deep-sea taxa within the Clarion-Clipperton Fracture Zone (CCZ), the area in the central equatorial Pacific where multiple mining licenses have been awarded to companies and governments. Specifically, these are licenses to mine polymetallic nodules which are small potato-sized deposits on the seafloor that are rich in several important minerals. These nodules provide hard substrate in an otherwise soft-substrate environment, and hence support distinct faunal communities. The larval dispersal models will help us to understand how areas within the CCZ are connected, and further develop our understanding of what the future effects of deep-sea mining might be on these fragile communities.

Aside from my main postdoctoral role, I am also actively engaged in a number of other projects and programmes. These include Challenger 150, a UN Ocean Decade Programme, where I am a member of the Central and South Atlantic Regional Working Group, and the Deep Ocean Stewardship Initiative (DOSI) where I am a member of the Fisheries Working Group. 

Since 2021, I have also undertaken some consultancy work. This has included analysis of image data collected by the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (advisers to the UK government) from the deep sea to the north of Scotland, and contribution to reports focusing on areas within the South Atlantic for Blue Marine Foundation.

Science communication and public engagement has always been a passion of mine, and in addition to my university-based and consultancy work, I am heavily involved in local marine conservation around Cornwall in the UK. I currently Chair the Looe Marine Conservation Group and act as their Scientific Officer. Alongside our public engagement campaign where we typically organise and run 30+ events per year ranging from guided rockpooling to beach cleaning, our scientific projects include monitoring of intertidal and subtidal habitats including rocky shores, seagrass beds and oyster reefs. I have combined this passion with my work at the University of Plymouth, enabling me to act as an external supervisor for undergraduate, postgraduate and placement students.
